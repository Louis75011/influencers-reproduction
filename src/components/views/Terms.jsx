        <p>
          We reserve the right to limit the quantities of the Marketplace

        <p>
          All sales are final and no refund will be issued unless both parties
          included in the transaction agree to cancel an order, or the Collabstr
          dispute resolution team decides that a refund is justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an order is placed with an influencer but the buyer fails to follow
          through with the order, or requests to cancel for reasons outside of
          Collabstr’s control, such as a lack of planning or organization, they
          will be subject to a fee upon refund.

          material in question. Please note that if you materially misrepresent
          that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or
          misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and

        <p>
          Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract,
          including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
          termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
          International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
          Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146)
          &nbsp;according to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of
          referring to it, is considered as the part of this clause. The number
          of arbitrators shall be one (1). The seat, or legal place, of
          arbitration shall be Vancouver, BC, Canada. The language of the
          proceedings shall be English. The governing law of the contract shall

        </p>
        <h4>Restrictions</h4>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
          between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
          (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
          any other persons.

          the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related
          to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
          privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.

          neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
          portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
          such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
          within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree
          to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

        <h2>Referral/Affiliate Program</h2>
        <p>
          <b>1. Introduction:</b> These Referral Program Terms are additional
          terms which apply if you use the Collabstr Referral Program. These
          Referral Program Terms form part of your agreement with us.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>2. Interpretation:</b> In these Referral Program Terms defined
          terms have the same meanings given to them in the Terms of Use, In
          addition:
        </p>

        <p>
          1. <b>"Referring User"</b> is also referred to as "you" or "your" in
          these Referral Program Terms; 2. <b>"Referred User"</b> means the
          person who joins Collabstr as a brand or influencer via the Referring
          User's unique referral link.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>3. What is the Collabstr Referral Program?</b> Collabstr offers a
          referral program by which existing Users can introduce people who are
          interested in becoming influencers or working with influencers to
          Collabstr and receive referral payments from Collabstr which are
          calculated and limited as described in these Referral Program Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>4. The rules of the Collabstr Referral Program:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Only Users of Collabstr with a current User account can participate
          in the Collabstr Referral Program. If a User's account has been
          suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by the User,
          that User will not be eligible to participate in the Collabstr
          Referral Program. 2. You will need on your referral page to submit
          PayPal details in order to receive referral payments under the
          Collabstr Referral Program. 3. Each User has a unique referral link
          (which can be accessed via the User's User account) which the User may
          share with others. When sharing your unique referral link you must not
          impersonate Collabstr or give the impression that your referral link
          is being shared or promoted by us. You must not use Google Ads or any
          similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service to
          share or promote your unique referral link. Upon our request, you must
          disclose the methods by which you share your unique referral link in
          the Bio/Website field of your Collabstr account. 4. The Referred User
          must click on your unique referral link and then register with
          Collabstr using the same browser that they used to click on your
          unique referral link. If someone registers with Collabstr other than
          by using your unique referral link, we will not link that account to
          your referral and we will not make any referral payment to you. 5. The
          Referred User must not have opened a User account with Collabstr
          (whether under the same name or another name) before clicking on your
          unique referral link. If the Referred User is currently or has
          previously been a User of Collabstr we will not make any referral
          payment to you for the referral. 6. If the Referred User sets up more
          than one User account we will make referral payments to you on the
          earnings made by the Referred User from their first User account only.
          We will not pay any referral payments to you on any further User
          accounts set up by the Referred User. 7. We will not pay any referral
          payments to you on any referral of a Referred User which we determine
          is owned or operated by you, or is in a commercial relationship with
          you. You will provide any information which we request to enable us to
          determine whether the Referred User is owned or operated by you or if
          there is a commercial relationship between you and the Referred User.
          8. You agree that when promoting Collabstr in any way as a Referring
          User:  you will not give a false impression of Collabstr, the
          services, programs, and content (including Content) made available
          through Collabstr, its Users or the Terms of Service; and  you will
          not make any statements which suggest to a potential Referred User
          that the potential Referred User will make a particular sum of money
          (or any money) from their use of Collabstr, or any statements
          regarding the likely number of sales.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>5. Referral payments:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. How are referral payments calculated? </b>Once a Referred User
          has become a registered User of Collabstr in accordance with the rules
          of the Collabstr Referral Program described above, we will pay the
          Referring User a referral payment equal to fifty percent of
          Collabstr’s net profit on the transaction, up to ten percent of the
          whole transaction. Referring Users are only entitled to payments for
          transactions that are considered completed by Collabstr.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. How frequently are referral payments made? </b>We will transfer
          to your Collabstr account the referral payment due to you on orders
          completed by your Referred Users in a calendar month on or around the
          first day of the next calendar month (which means, for example, that
          referral payments due to you in respect of Fan Payments made to the
          Referred User in February shall be paid to you on or around 1 March).
          For your first payment you may be required to meet a minimum threshold
          of $100 before receiving your referral payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. Who bears the cost of the referral payment? </b>The cost of the
          referral payment is borne by us, not the Referred User.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>6. Our rights relating to the referral program.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If referral payments have been made incorrectly then we have the
          right to recover the wrongly paid sums from the User to whom the
          wrongly paid sums have been paid. 2. We may request you or Referred
          Users (or both) to provide us with ID and other information reasonably
          required by us to verify any referral payment to be made and the
          person to whom any referral payment should be made. Failure to provide
          any information requested by us may lead to you losing your
          entitlement to referral payments in respect of the relevant Referred
          User. 3. We may change any aspect of the Collabstr Referral Program
          (including how referral payments are calculated) or discontinue the
          Collabstr Referral Program at any time, but no change will deprive any
          Referring User of referral payments already earned based on payments
          made to Referred Users before the changes came into effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>7. Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We may withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you
          but not yet paid out:  if we think that you have or may have
          seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service; 
          if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service
          in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or
          another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or
          another User); or  if we suspect that all or any part of the referral
          payments due to you result from unlawful activity, either by you, by
          the customer who made the payment to the Referred User which resulted
          in the referral payment, or by the Referred User to whom the payment
          was made which resulted in the referral payment, for as long as is
          necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected
          breach(es) by you or the suspected unlawful activity (as applicable).
          If following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have
          seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;
          (ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms
          of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for
          us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or
          another User), and/or (iii) all or any part of referral payments due
          to you result from unlawful activity, we may notify you that you have
          forfeited all or any part of your referral payments. 2. We shall not
          have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment
          due to you under the Collabstr Referral Program where we have a right
          to do so under these Referral Program Terms. 3. If we are withholding
          all or any part of the referral payments due to you and we determine
          that part of the referral payments withheld by us is unrelated to
          breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful
          activity, then we may pay to you the part of the referral payments
          which is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or
          suspected unlawful activity. However, you agree that if we consider
          that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss,
          we may withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid and
          we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.

        <h4>Influencer Marketplace</h4>
        <p>
          Upon placing an order with an influencer on the influencer
          marketplace, influencers must submit the requested work through the
          site in order to receive their funds. Upon submission of work, the
          buyer will have 48 hours to ask for a revision from the influencer or
          dispute the work with Collabstr, before the order is automatically
          closed and the money is paid to the influencer. If the influencer
          (seller) submits the required deliverables for the order, the brand
          (buyer) may not receive a refund for the order. All disputes are
          handled by the Collabstr arbitration team. All dispute decisions are
          final and are at the sole discretion of the Collabstr arbitration
          team. Collabstr is not responsible for any lost product or funds. If
          you choose to send anything, such as physical product, to an
          influencer to assist them with the collaboration you are responsible
          with all costs associated with that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collabstr can only pay influencers out via Stripe, any other payment
          methods are not supported. If a buyer or seller chooses to take
          communication or transactions outside of the site, Collabstr does not
          take any responsibility for the order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collabstr holds the right to refund any payment made to an influencer
          if we believe there is valid reason to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
